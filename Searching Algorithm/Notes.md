***Objectives***

    * Describe what a searching algorithm
    * Implement linear search on arrays
    * implement linear search on sorted arrays
    * implement a naive string searching algorithm
    * implement the KMP string searchign algorithm

    Javascript has built in linear search
        * indexOf()
        * includes()
        * find()
        * findIndex()

Linear Search - Big O
Best case = O(1)
average case - O(n)
Worst case - O(n)

***Binary Search***
    * Binary search is a much faster form of search
    * Rather than elimating one element at a time, BS can elimiante half of the remaining elements at a time.
    * Binary search only works on sorted arrays
    * The core idea of Binary Search is *Divide and Conquer*

    Worst and Average Case - O(log n)
    Best Case - O(1)
